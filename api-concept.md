# Concept Overview

The Responsible Gambling Content Signals API is a **non-operational, abstract model** designed to demonstrate how gambling-related content can be analyzed for responsibility and transparency indicators.

The API does not produce judgments or ratings. Instead, it extracts **observable signals** that help contextualize how information may influence reader perception.
